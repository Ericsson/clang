These are the measurement result of the Cross Translation Unit (CTU) prototype for 
Clang Static Analyzer on some open source projects.
CTU allows Clang Static Analyzer to analyze called functions even if they are defined in different translation units (C/C++ source files).
The resuts show that this analysis mode can find many additional bugs compared to the single TU analysis.

<br><br>
You can find the CTU patched clang 4.0 in the following GitHub fork:
<a href="https://github.com/Ericsson/clang/tree/ctu-master">https://github.com/Ericsson/clang/tree/ctu-master</a>
<br><br>
The design concept is described <a href="http://cc.elte.hu/clang-ctu/eurollvm17/abstract.pdf">here</a>.
<br>
The analysis is run in 2 phases

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Where you find "Max heap usage..." other than 0 clang was executed with Valgrind memory analysis which increased the analysis time. 
      Don't use these measurements for comaparing analysis time.</li>
  <li>The analysis of some files failed in CTU mode, due to some faults in ASTImporter. By incrementally fixing ASTImporter, these failures will disappear. </li>
